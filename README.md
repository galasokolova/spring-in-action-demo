### Spring in Action Tutorials Project

This project was created as a practical guide and code samples based on 
### *"Spring in Action", 6th Edition by Craig Walls.* 
https://books.google.pt/books?id=2zVbEAAAQBAJ&printsec=copyright&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false

It consists of independent module-based mini-projects, each demonstrating concepts covered in a specific chapter or part of a chapter of the book.

### About the Project
The project is organized into separate modules, 
each showcasing various features and usage examples of the Spring framework. 
These modules are designed to be self-contained mini-projects, 
each with its own README that explains the objectives and usage of the module.

### Differences from the Book
Unlike the code examples in the book, which use earlier versions of the Spring framework, this project is built with:

* Spring Boot 3
* Spring Framework 6

### Contents
Each module in this project corresponds to a specific topic from the book and is self-contained, 
allowing for a focused study of particular Spring concepts. For instance, the project includes modules for:

* Deploying applications in Kubernetes on Google Cloud
* Using MongoDB and Redis
* Implementing REST APIs
* Handling events, configuring security, and other topics

Please refer to the README file of each module for detailed information.
