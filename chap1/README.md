- Writing a simple controller (`HomeController`)
- Setting up view rendering using Thymeleaf
- Running a standalone Spring Boot application from the command line

> 🚫 **Note:** This module does **not use any database**. Database integration starts in later chapters.

- 

### 🚀 How to run the project:

#### Option 1: From terminal
```bash
   cd  chap1

You can also run the application by executing the main() method in the TacoCloudApplication class:
